      During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects for the Deep Space Fleet.
      Performed acceptence testing of the DS1 SuperLAser in 0 BBY by annihilating alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Succesfully tripled the deep space fire power of the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
